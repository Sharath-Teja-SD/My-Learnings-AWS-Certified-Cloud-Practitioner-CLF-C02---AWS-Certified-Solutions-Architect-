## ‚òÅÔ∏è EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud.  
It allows you to **rent virtual servers (instances)** to run applications and services.

### üîπ Key Benefits:
- Reduces hardware costs
- Launch as many/few instances as needed
- Configure security, networking, storage
- Easily scale up/down
- Pre-configured templates: **Amazon Machine Images (AMI)**
- Default limit: **20 running instances per EC2 Region** (excluding stopped, hibernated, or pending)

---

## üèóÔ∏è EC2 = Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Main capabilities:
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data (EBS)
- Load balancing (ELB)
- Auto-scaling (ASG)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è EC2 Configuration Options

- Operating System (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- CPU: Compute power & cores
- RAM: Memory capacity
- Storage:
  - Network-attached (EBS, EFS)
  - Local (Instance Store)
- Network card: Speed, Public IP
- Security: Security Groups (Firewall Rules)
- **Bootstrap Script:** EC2 User Data

---

## üìú EC2 User Data

- Automates tasks on first launch (bootstrapping)
- Runs as **root** user
- Example tasks:
  - Install updates
  - Install software
  - Download files

## üß± EC2 Instance Types - Overview

AWS provides different instance types optimized for specific workloads.  
**Naming Convention Example:** `m5.2xlarge`
- `m`: Instance class
- `5`: Generation
- `2xlarge`: Size
